# FPGA_4Bit_Adder
Same MIMAS V2 Spartan 6 FPGA used for this project. 4 bit Binary adder was constructed using the 8 Dip switches as two 4-bit inputs 
Image "5_Plus_12" show how the two 4-bit inputs are separated on the dip switch. The left 4 switches (1-4) make up the input A, leftmost switch being the MSB. The remaining switches make up input B (5-8). Again, the leftmost switch being the MSB.
